# AutoTrade Core — Public Overview

AutoTrade Core is a high-level, modular, and research-oriented framework designed for **strategy development, backtesting, and AI-assisted trading experimentation**.  
This repository provides the **public-facing documentation** for the architecture, design philosophy, and roadmap of the project.  
All implementation details remain private.

## Vision

AutoTrade Core aims to provide a flexible and extensible backbone for:

- Systematic trading research  
- Evaluation and comparison of trading strategies  
- Risk modeling and simulation  
- Future integration of **Reinforcement Learning**, **LLM-driven meta-strategies**, and **behavioral/emotional agents**  
- Building a multi-layer structure that can eventually handle both **offline backtests** and **real-time trading**

The philosophy is: **MVP → Stability → Iterative Expansion**.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Modularity  
Every component (Data, Strategy, Risk, Engine, AI) is replaceable and isolated.

### 2. Separation of Concerns  
Data processing, decision-making, risk filtering, and execution simulation are strictly separated.

### 3. Extensibility  
The architecture supports adding new strategies, data sources, analytics tools, and AI models without breaking existing functionality.

### 4. Clean Research Workflow  
Scenario-driven experimentation ensures reproducibility and scientific rigor.

## High-Level Architecture

AutoTrade Core consists of four foundational layers:

1. **Data Layer**  
   Handles OHLCV datasets, synthetic generators, normalization pipelines.

2. **Strategy Layer**  
   Hosts rule-based and AI-based decision-making components.

3. **Risk Layer**  
   Applies portfolio and volatility constraints, position sizing, stop systems.

4. **Backtest Engine**  
   Simulates market execution, accounting for fills, P&L, and equity curves.

Additional optional layers include:

- **AI/Agent Layer** (RL, LLMs, hybrid emotional agents)  
- **Analytics Layer** (performance reporting, visualization, comparative analysis)

## Strategy Categories (Conceptual)

- **Baseline**
  - Buy & Hold
  - Simple filters and thresholds  
- **Trend-Following**
  - MA crossover logic  
  - Breakouts and channel strategies  
- **Mean-Reversion**
  - Oscillator-driven setups  
  - Reversion-to-mean techniques  
- **Risk-Aware**
  - Volatility-adjusted position sizing  
  - Drawdown and exposure constraints  
- **AI & Hybrid (Planned)**
  - RL agents interacting with the engine  
  - LLM-assisted signal curation  
  - Emotional/behavioral agents for experimental finance research

## Data Sources

Conceptually supports:

- Synthetic time series (controlled scenarios)  
- Real historical candles (crypto, stocks, FX)  
- Normalized/preprocessed data formats  

Actual loaders and data modules exist only in the private repository.

## Workflow Summary

A typical workflow in AutoTrade Core:

1. Choose dataset  
2. Configure strategy & risk parameters  
3. Run backtest scenario  
4. Generate logs, metrics, and equity curves  
5. Compare multiple strategies or parameter sets  
6. Iterate  

The system is built for clarity, reproducibility, and extensibility.

## Roadmap (High-Level)

- Portfolio-level backtesting  
- Advanced risk engines  
- Visualization & analytics suite  
- Modular RL environment for training agents  
- Integration with LLM-based meta-strategies  
- Realtime trading interfaces (separate module)  
- Agent-based behavioral modeling (long-term research)
