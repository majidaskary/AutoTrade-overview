# AutoTrade Core — Project Overview

Because the repository and source code are private, this document provides a high-level explanation of the project **without exposing source code, internal implementation details, or proprietary technical decisions**.

This file is intended for non-technical or semi-technical readers who need to understand what the project is, what has already been completed, and what comes next.

## What the Project Is

AutoTrade Core is a private engineering project focused on building a **reliable, deterministic, contract-driven foundation for algorithmic trading systems**.

It is not being built as a quick trading bot or as a set of disconnected scripts.  
It is being built as a structured platform that can support:

- market-data handling
- descriptive and intelligence layers
- decision systems
- execution systems
- risk and portfolio control layers
- evaluation and go-live decision layers
- future product and automation expansion

This document is a **high-level overview only**.  
It intentionally avoids source code, internal implementation details, and proprietary design specifics.

## What the Project Is Trying to Build

The long-term goal of AutoTrade Core is to create a trading platform that can:

- process market data in a reliable and repeatable way
- support research and strategy development
- provide a clean decision layer for trading logic
- provide a governed execution layer
- provide a capital-aware Risk / Portfolio foundation
- support evaluation and go-live decision layers
- grow into a broader platform over time

In simple terms:

**the project is building the infrastructure first, so later trading behavior can be built on top of a strong foundation rather than on shortcuts.**

---

## Why This Project Exists

Many trading systems become difficult to trust as they grow.  
They often start as small experiments and then turn into a mixture of indicators, scripts, exceptions, and hidden assumptions.

AutoTrade Core is taking a different path.

The project is being developed around a few clear principles:

- **reliability before speed**
- **clarity before shortcuts**
- **repeatability before convenience**
- **architecture before feature sprawl**
- **long-term scalability over temporary hacks**

That makes progress slower at the beginning, but much stronger later.

### Approximate composition

- **Python share of the tracked codebase:** ~80.6%
- **Markdown/documentation share:** ~17.4%

This shows that the project is already a large engineering codebase, with substantial investment in both implementation and governance/documentation.

---

## Quality Snapshot

Latest full verified test run after EPIC 4 closeout:

- **2351 tests passed**

This matters because the project is not only growing in size; it is being developed with a strong emphasis on **verification, regression safety, and controlled evolution**.

---

## What Has Been Completed So Far

By the end of EPIC 1, EPIC 2, EPIC 3, and EPIC 4, the project has built the four core foundation layers required before formal evaluation and go-live work can be trusted.

That completed foundation includes:

- **historical market data foundation**
- **live deterministic market-event and candle processing**
- **feature and indicator infrastructure**
- **market context construction**
- **integrity, audit, and quality-governance layers**
- **a first non-price data extension boundary**
- **a canonical Strategy Engine / Decision Layer**
- **deterministic strategy runtime and orchestration semantics**
- **decision logging, audit, parity, and hardening surfaces**
- **a canonical execution contract family**
- **decision-to-execution translation and admission foundations**
- **order identity and lifecycle foundations**
- **fill, execution outcome, fee, and slippage foundations**
- **execution adapter/runtime foundations**
- **execution-layer classification, alignment, and freeze-ready closeout anchors**
- **Risk / Portfolio boundary contracts**
- **sizing and capital semantics**
- **exposure-control semantics**
- **portfolio state and mutation semantics**
- **valuation, equity, PnL, and accounting-boundary semantics**
- **runtime/review/reporting interpretation semantics**
- **Risk / Portfolio ownership map**
- **Risk / Portfolio boundary seam registry**
- **Risk / Portfolio deferred ownership registry**
- **Risk / Portfolio evaluation handoff contract**
- **Risk / Portfolio change policy**
- **Risk / Portfolio readiness verification harness**
- **final Risk / Portfolio layer readiness gate**

In practical terms, the project can now:

- organize and process market information consistently
- preserve repeatability across runs
- detect and surface quality issues instead of hiding them
- prepare structured market-state outputs for downstream strategy layers
- produce controlled decision-layer outputs on top of governed descriptive truth
- define controlled execution-layer meaning on top of governed decision truth
- define capital-aware Risk / Portfolio foundation semantics on top of governed execution truth
- provide a strong engineering base for evaluation, go-live governance, and later controlled live-readiness work

---

## What the Platform Can Do After EPIC 4

At this stage, the platform is no longer only a data, decision, or execution foundation.

It can now function as a **serious descriptive, decision, execution, and Risk / Portfolio foundation**.

That means it can already support:

- structured market data ingestion and handling
- deterministic processing of historical and live market information
- repeatable feature computation
- market-state preparation for downstream strategy layers
- deterministic strategy / decision-layer behavior on top of canonical descriptive truth
- controlled execution-layer semantics after accepted decision outputs
- order / fill / execution-outcome interpretation
- bounded simulated execution posture and execution-facing runtime/reporting outputs
- canonical Risk / Portfolio ownership boundaries
- sizing, exposure, portfolio-state, valuation, and PnL foundation semantics
- bounded accounting-boundary posture
- explicit deferred ownership for accounting, settlement, reconciliation, productization, live-provider operations, and go-live authorization
- machine-checkable readiness for downstream evaluation/governance consumption
- audit-friendly and review-friendly engineering workflows
- future expansion without reopening the upstream foundations

This is a major milestone because many system failures happen when projects try to build evaluation or live-capital logic on top of weak descriptive, decision, execution, or risk foundations.  
Those upstream and Risk / Portfolio layers are now closed through EPIC 4.

---

## What Has Not Been Closed Yet

Even after EPIC 4, the project is **not** yet a live-capital-authorized trading product.

The following are intentionally still outside the closed scope:

- full live-trading implementation
- evaluation and go-live judgment ownership
- final go-live approval criteria
- settlement / bookkeeping / accounting ownership
- broker or external-account reconciliation
- production operator tooling
- broader platform/product concerns

This is intentional.

The project is being built in the following order:

**foundation → decisions → execution → risk/control → evaluation → productization**

Risk / Portfolio readiness is not go-live authorization.

---

## What Comes Next

The next major stage is expected to introduce the **Evaluation & Go-Live Gate**.

That is where the platform is expected to begin defining:

- end-to-end validation
- deterministic backtest validation
- paper-trading validation
- evaluation evidence
- performance and risk acceptance criteria
- go-live checklist and approval boundary
- final pre-live gate criteria

After that, later work is expected to introduce:

- controlled live-readiness work
- broader operational controls
- capital scaling after evidence
- larger platform/product capabilities

---

## What Phase 1 Is Expected to Achieve

When the broader Phase 1 program is finished, the project is expected to support:

- deterministic market-data handling
- structured decision-making layers
- controlled execution infrastructure
- capital/risk protection layers
- evaluation and deployment readiness checks
- explicit go-live approval gates

So EPIC 1, EPIC 2, EPIC 3, and EPIC 4 should be understood as:

**the completed descriptive, decision, execution, and Risk / Portfolio foundation of the core trading program, not the final live-authorized product.**

---

## Technology Stack

The project is built primarily in:

- **Python** as the main implementation language
- structured documentation and configuration files
- automated testing and validation workflows

For a non-technical reader, the important point is simple:

**the project is being built as a serious software system, not as a one-off prototype.**

---

## What Makes the Project Different

AutoTrade Core is not trying to impress through flashy demos first.

Its real strength is in how it is being built:

- carefully
- systematically
- with long-term structure
- with visible progress
- with room for future growth

The aim is to create something that can become dependable, explainable, and extensible — not something that works once and collapses when complexity increases.

---

## Repository Scope

This repository is private.

The purpose of this overview file is to explain:

- what the project is
- where it currently stands
- what has already been achieved
- what comes next

It intentionally does **not** expose:

- source code
- private internal architecture details
- proprietary implementation ideas
- confidential design decisions

## In One Sentence

**AutoTrade Core is a private, large-scale software project building a deterministic, contract-driven, and scalable trading infrastructure — and EPIC 1 through EPIC 4 now close the descriptive, decision, execution, and Risk / Portfolio foundation that the final evaluation and go-live layer will build on.**
